# Lab Protocols Repository

Welcome to the **Lab Protocols Repository**! This repository is designed to
store, update, and share all of the experimental protocols used in our
biophysical AI laboratory. The goal is to keep protocols well-organized,
version-controlled, and easily accessible for all lab members.

## Introduction

This repository contains the protocols we follow for experiments, including
molecular biology, directed evolution, fluorescence analysis, and other
biophysical techniques. Each protocol is meticulously documented, versioned, and
organized for ease of access.

We use **GitHub Wikis** for easy access and browsing of protocols, and **Pull
Requests (PRs)** for reviewing changes and ensuring protocol updates are
properly tracked.

## How to Use

### 1. Accessing Protocols

All protocols are documented in the **[GitHub
Wiki](https://github.com/darosio/lab-protocols/wiki)** section of this
repository. You can easily navigate through the protocols based on categories
(e.g., Protein Expression, DNA Assembly, Fluorescence Imaging, etc.).

1. Click on the **Wiki** tab.
2. Browse or search for the protocol you need.
3. Each protocol includes step-by-step instructions, necessary materials, and
   additional notes.

### 2 Downloading Protocols

You can download any protocol for offline use by either:

- Copying the Markdown content from the Wiki page and pasting it into a document.
- Using the git clone command to clone the entire repository (including the Wiki).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
```

### Submitting Changes

If you need to make changes to a protocol or suggest improvements:

1. Create a New Branch:
   Always work on a new branch, never directly on the `main` branch.
